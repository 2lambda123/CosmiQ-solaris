# This skeleton lays out the required instructions for running a model using
# cw-nets. See the full documentation at [INCLUDE DOC LINK HERE] for details on
# options, required arguments, and sample usage.

model_name: # include the name of the model to be used here. See the docs
            # for options.
model_path: # leave this blank unless you're using a custom model not native
            # to solaris. solaris will automatically find your model.
train: true  # set to false for inference only
infer: true  # set to false for training only

pretrained: true  # use pretrained weights associated with the model?
model_src:  # if not using a model included with the package, you must specify
            # a path to find the model architecture. See documentation.
nn_framework:  # if not using a model included with the package, use this
               # argument to specify if it uses keras, pytorch, tf, etc.
batch_size:  # size of each batch fed into nn.

data_specs:
  width: # width of the input images taken in by the neural net.
  height:  # height of the input images taken in by the neural net.
  image_type: normalized # format of images. options are 'normalized',
                         # 'zscore', '8bit', '16bit'
  channels:  # number of channels in the input imagery.
  label_type: mask  # one of ['mask', 'bbox']
  mask_channels: 1  # number of channels in the training mask
  val_holdout_frac:  # if empty, assumes that separate data ref files define the
                     # training and validation dataset. If a float between 0 and
                     # 1, indicates the fraction of training data that's held
                     # out for validation (and validation_data_csv will be
                     # ignored)
  data_workers:  # number of cpu threads to use for loading and preprocessing
                 # input images.
#  other_inputs:  # this can provide a list of additional inputs to pass to the
                 # neural net for training. These inputs should be specified in
                 # extra columns of the csv files (denoted below), either as
                 # filepaths to additional data to load or as values to include.
                 # NOTE: This is not currently implemented.

training_data_csv:  # path to the reference csv that defines training data.
                    # see the documentation for the specifications of this file.
validation_data_csv:  # path to the validation ref csv. See the docs. If
                      # val_holdout_frac is specified (under data_specs), then
                      # this argument will be ignored.
inference_data_csv:  # path to the reference csv that defines inference data.
                     # see the documentation for the specs of this file.

training_augmentation:  # augmentations for use with training data
  augmentations:
    # include augmentations here. See the documentation for options and
    # required arguments.
  p: 1.0  # probability of applying the entire training augmentation pipeline.
  shuffle: true  # should the image order be shuffled in each epoch.
validation_augmentation:  # augmentations for use with validation data
  augmentations:
    # include augmentations here
  p:  # probability of applying the full validation augmentation pipeline.
inference_augmentation:  # this is optional. If not provided,
                         # validation_augmentation will be used instead.

training:
  epochs:  # number of epochs. A list can also be provided here indicating
           # distinct sets of epochs at different learning rates, etc; if so,
           # a list of equal length must be provided in the parameter that varies
           # with the values for each set of epochs.
  steps_per_epoch:  # optional argument defining # steps/epoch. If not provided,
                    # each epoch will include the number of steps needed to go
                    # through the entire training dataset.
  optimizer:  # optimizer function name. see docs for options.
  lr:  # learning rate.
  opt_args:  # dictionary of values (e.g. alpha, gamma, momentum) specific to
             # the optimizer.
  loss:  # loss function name. See docs for options. If using a composite loss
         # function, enter composite here, then specify the individual components
         # in a subdict below with keys loss_1, loss_2, etc. Parameters to the
         # loss function should also be specified in this subdict (or in
         # subdicts for the components of the composite loss function). See the
         # docs for an example.
  sublosses:  # individual loss functions that comprise a composite loss. Only
              # has an effect if using loss: 'composite'.
  loss_weights:  # (optional) weights to use for each loss function if using
                 # loss: composite. This must be a set of key:value pairs where
                 # defining the weight for each sub-loss within the composite.
                 # If using a composite and a value isn't provided here, all
                 # losses will be weighted equally.
  loss_params:  # (optional) this should have sub-headings of
                # argument_name: value pairs to be converted to a dict, which
                # will be passed to the loss function as kwargs.
  checkpoint_frequency:  # how frequently should checkpoints be saved?
                         # this can be an int, in which case every n epochs
                         # a checkpoint will be made, or a list, in which case
                         # checkpoints will be saved on those specific epochs.
                         # if not provided, only the final model is saved.
  additional_callbacks:  # a list of callbacks to use.

inference:
  window_step_size:  # size of each step for the sliding window for inference.
                     # set to the same size as the input image size for zero
                     # overlap; to average predictions across multiple images,
                     # use a smaller step size.
