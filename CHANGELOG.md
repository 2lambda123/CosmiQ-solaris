# Changelog

## Instructions

Anytime you add something new to this project, add a new item under the appropriate sub-heading of the [Unreleased](#unreleased) portion of this document. That item should be formatted as follows:
```
[Date (ISO format)], [GitHub username]: [Short description of change] [(PR number)]
```
e.g.
```
20190930, nrweir: Added changelog (#259)
```
Consistent with the "one PR per task" paradigm, we recommend having only one changelog entry per PR whenever possible; however, multiple entries can be included for a single PR if needed to capture the full changeset.

When a new version of `solaris` is released, all of the changes in the Unreleased portion will be moved to the newest release version.
